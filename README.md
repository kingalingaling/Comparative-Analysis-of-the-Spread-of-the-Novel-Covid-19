# Comparative-Analysis-of-the-Spread-of-the-Novel-Covid-19
My final year university project on the spread of the coronavirus, with particular attention paid to Africa and Nigeria
The project models the trends of the evolution of worldwide COVID-19 infections, performing data analysis via comparison of regional trends with focus on Africa and Nigeria. Using a standard incidence SIRF model, the SIRF dynamics are expressed using differential equations. We first derive the parameters of the model from the available daily data history of infections, recoveries and deaths. The derived parameters have been aggregated to visualize trends and show relationships between parameters. The visualizations are meant to serve as a measure of the effectiveness of socio-political counter measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This article considers data between the first instance of the virus (December 31st, 2019) and the approval of the first vaccine (December 31st, 2020). From the results, actual data shows much better trends than the SIRF model predictions.
